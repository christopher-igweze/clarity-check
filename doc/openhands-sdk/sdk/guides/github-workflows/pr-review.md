# PR Review

> Use OpenHands Agent to generate meaningful pull request review

> The reference workflow is available [here](#reference-workflow)!

Automatically review pull requests, providing feedback on code quality, security, and best practices. Reviews can be triggered in two ways:

* Requesting `openhands-agent` as a reviewer
* Adding the `review-this` label to the PR

<Note>
  The reference workflow triggers on either the "review-this" label or when the openhands-agent account is requested as a reviewer. In OpenHands organization repositories, openhands-agent has access, so this works as-is. In your own repositories, requesting openhands-agent will only work if that account is added as a collaborator or is part of a team with access. If you don't plan to grant access, use the label trigger instead, or change the condition to a reviewer handle that exists in your repo.
</Note>

## Quick Start

```bash  theme={null}
# 1. Copy workflow to your repository
cp examples/03_github_workflows/02_pr_review/workflow.yml .github/workflows/pr-review.yml

# 2. Configure secrets in GitHub Settings → Secrets
# Add: LLM_API_KEY

# 3. (Optional) Create a "review-this" label in your repository
# Go to Issues → Labels → New label
# You can also trigger reviews by requesting "openhands-agent" as a reviewer
```

## Features

* **Fast Reviews** - Results posted on the PR in only 2 or 3 minutes
* **Comprehensive Analysis** - Analyzes the changes given the repository context. Covers code quality, security, best practices
* **GitHub Integration** - Posts comments directly to the PR
* **Customizable** - Add your own code review guidelines without forking

## Security

* Users with write access (maintainers) can trigger reviews by requesting `openhands-agent` as a reviewer or adding the `review-this` label.
* Maintainers need to read the PR to make sure it's safe to run.

## Customizing the Code Review

Instead of forking the `agent_script.py`, you can customize the code review behavior by adding a `.agents/skills/code-review.md` file to your repository. This is the **recommended approach** for customization.

### How It Works

The PR review agent uses skills from the [OpenHands/skills](https://github.com/OpenHands/skills) repository by default. When you add a `.openhands/skills/code-review.md` file to your repository, it **overrides** the default skill with your custom guidelines.

### Example: Custom Code Review Skill

Create `.openhands/skills/code-review.md` in your repository:

```markdown  theme={null}
---
name: code-review
description: Custom code review guidelines for my project
triggers:
- /codereview
---

# My Project Code Review Guidelines

You are a code reviewer for this project. Follow these guidelines:

## Review Decisions

- **APPROVE** straightforward changes (config updates, typo fixes, documentation)
- **COMMENT** when you have feedback or concerns

## What to Check

- Code follows our project conventions
- Tests are included for new functionality
- No security vulnerabilities introduced
- Documentation is updated if needed

## Communication Style

- Be direct and constructive
- Use GitHub suggestion syntax for code fixes
- Approve quickly when code is good
```

### Benefits of Custom Skills

1. **No forking required**: Keep using the official SDK while customizing behavior
2. **Version controlled**: Your review guidelines live in your repository
3. **Easy updates**: SDK updates don't overwrite your customizations
4. **Team alignment**: Everyone uses the same review standards

<Note>
  See the [software-agent-sdk's own code-review skill](https://github.com/OpenHands/software-agent-sdk/blob/main/.openhands/skills/code-review.md) for a complete example of a custom code review skill.
